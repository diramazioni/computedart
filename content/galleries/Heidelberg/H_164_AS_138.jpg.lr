description:

The neck of a stringed instrument, such as a violin, ends
with a scroll, similar to fiddlehead ferns and to croziers
(shepherd's crooks used by bishops). It is a variation of the
Fibonacci spiral. The withdrawn silhouette of “L’homme qui
marche” by the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti, walks on
the spiral. The title pays a tribute also to Mussorgsky's
“Pictures at an exhibition”.
