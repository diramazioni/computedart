description:

Rotogons are solids obtained by rotating a polygon around an
edge, a diagonal or any linear element. The rich internal
structure of the rotogon can be appreciated by viewing cross
sections, which are equivalent to partial rotations. Using this
method, this image is the internal structure of a rotogon
generated by an intertwined heptagon.
