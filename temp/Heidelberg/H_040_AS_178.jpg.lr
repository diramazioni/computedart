description:

The image uses the same linear fractal (Gosper’s flake)
used in “Moonlight,” employing a circular inversion to
produce paths converging towards a sort of fractal
“island.” Aldo Spizzichino referred to this fractal island askind of “Neverland,” towards which the Gosper's flake
converges, but never reaches.
