description:

The Oroborus is one of the oldest mystical symbols in the world,
depicting a snake or dragon eating its own tail to form a circle,
or other closed curve. It evokes ideas of cyclicity, unity and
infinity. The little snake inside seems to want to mimic the
elegant knot of the parent snake. The figure is derived from a
generalized cylinder with a trifolium curve as generating line.
