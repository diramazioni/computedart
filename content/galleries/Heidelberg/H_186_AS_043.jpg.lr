description:

The egg, as a perfect form and as a symbol of
unexpressed potentials, is here taken as a sign of good
omen for the millennium to come.
The wooden bowl is made from level lines of a function of
two variables, projected onto the rim and onto a spherical
shell forming the hollow part. The shading of the egg is
obtained with an elementary model of light diffusion, without the use of ray-tracing.
