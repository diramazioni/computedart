As an example of how a drawing can be built by using only
tangent circles, this playful portrait of Muhammad ibn Musa al-
Khwarizmi (about 780 - about 850), pays homage to one of the
most prominent algebraic scholars, who spent most of his live in
Baghdad, where he was Director of the famous library Bayt al-
Hikma (House of Wisdom). The word “algorithm” is derived from
the Latinization of his name.
