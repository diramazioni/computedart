description:

The outline on the chessboard shows one of the six possible
paths with which a chess horse can touch all the chessboard
boxes without going through the same box more than once.
The pattern on the horseâ€™s flank is rendered by interference
fringes obtained by the superimposition of two series of lines
that interpolate between the external edges of the figure.
