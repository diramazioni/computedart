description:

Here, both polyhedra are snub dodecahedrons projected onto the
surface of a sphere. For the larger polyhedron, the inset of each face
is derived from what we would see if we were looking at the
polyhedron from the center of that face, using a fish-eye lens. For the
smaller polyhedron, the fish-eye view is centered at various vertices.
