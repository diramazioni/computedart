description:

Each pictogram in the matrix is a minimum weight spanning
tree, the set of edges of a connected, undirected graph that
connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with
the minimum possible total edge weight. After smoothing
through interpolation, these shapes suggest a sort of primitive
alphabet evolving from pictograms towards modern phonetic
symbols.
