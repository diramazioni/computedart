description:

A hyperbolic projection of a heptagonal tessellation on the surface
of a biconvex shape, reminiscent of a space capsule or perhaps a
flying saucer. Aldo Spizzichino described the flying saucer as a
container carrying the imprinting of our civilization to outer space,
guarding it from, rather than conveying it to alien beings.
