description:

Climbing plants ascend the walls of a balcony, as if to get a
wider view. Itâ€™s a visual metaphor of human curiosity, propulsive
force toward the unexplored world.

The growth pattern was not drawn "freehand", but is derived
from an algorithmic process known as diffusion limited
aggregation, briefly described as follows:
a sticky particle (a small disc) is placed at the base of the plant. A myriad of other
particles enter the scene at random and migrate towards a point in the sheet, and
aggregating with the nearest particle already attached to the structure. This simple
model of dendritic growth is sufficient to produce realistic branching. The diameter of
the disks decreases progressively with the quota.
