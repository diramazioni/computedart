description:

An isohedral tessellation of the plane undergoes a random
perturbation of increasing inter-tessera distance and angle variation
from the bottom up. The basic unit is a non-regular pentagon with
two angles of 40 degrees, two of 160 and one of 140. The white disk
in the background appears to be the engine of this "phase transition"
evocative of the moon's influence on the plant world and beyond.
