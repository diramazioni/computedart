description:

The composition consists of the random arrangement of a
number of curved hexagons, each dotted with small points of
different color. Each of these curved hexagons is the image of
the hexagonal frame as it would appear through a cylindrical
mirror as viewed from several different positions inside the
window.

The effect suggests the first lights of a sky at the end of a storm.
