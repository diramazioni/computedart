description:

The two stylized figures are derived from ruled surfaces. The lower
and upper bases of the two figures are polygons with curved sides
bent inward and outward, and having opposite curvatures for each
figure.

The shape of the surfaces suggests a slow rotation: almost a dance
that is reminiscent of the rotation of the starry vault.
