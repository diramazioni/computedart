The “eyes” of this sort of enigmatic totem are a three-
dimensional interpretation of the Cassini oval, the locus of points
in the plane such that the product of the distances to two fixed
points is constant. Aldo Spizzichino, as a former astronomer,
would certainly have thought of the vast distances through which
the Cassini space probe is passing, thus the title of this work.
